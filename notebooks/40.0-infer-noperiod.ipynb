I can have a few more dozens of these! Second best item to get and I would HIGHLY recommend is their fried fish, It was battered up lightly and the fish was so tender and moist, I had this last year when I visited New Orleans and the taste, texture and freshness of the fish was still the same, Each bite had its own crunch, I am in love!

Place is pretty small but the staff was prompt and attentive! Put in our order for chargrilled oysters and some gravy fries and felt like minutes later they were back with our apps, Both where awesome! The chargrilled oysters were definitely the bomb, I think they sprinkle crack on them, We had picky teenagers with us and even they ate the oysters and we had to fight them for the last couple, It was loads of fun, We ordered po-boy, beans and rice, bread bowl and gumbo, Everything was okay but doesn't measure up to the oysters, We'd go back for the apps, oysters and beer, but the rest of the food was just ok, We were in from out of town and tried several oyster spots before going here, Well worth the wait but you must get the chargrilled oysters, You have better options for entrees but overall we were glad to find this spot.\n",

      "Wow, just wow!  My memory must've been foggy because when I came over 12+ years ago, I didn't remember it being such a slam dunk!As you all know, this is one of those touristy places that you have to go to if you've never been to NOLA but for the record, let me tell you, it's SO worth the trip, We tried Felix, Killer Poboy and NOLA Poboys all in the same week and none of these places served a better Poboy than the Peacemaker at Acme, So ginormous, you can actually just share this and you'd still be full to the gills, GET IT! 5/5And contrary to popular opinion as New Englanders, I'd also stuff your face with at least a half dozen of the Chargrilled Oysters as opposed to ordering the standard raw preparation, Taste tested and confirmed as we ordered both, I know you're shocked! Why you ask? It's actually quite simple, The local oysters here from the Gulf of Mexico (on average) are much larger yet more milder tasting so it's perfect to try these prepared in other cooking methods,  We absolutely enjoyed these and it's forever changed our perspective that a cooked oyster could never taste as good as the raw variety, 5/5  If you're into crab cakes, they do it quite well here too, Ask for a side of their special house remoulade sauce and make sure you smother it well with it, You can work it all off later :) 4/5Really liked the decor of the place too, It added to the friendly, casual Southern character you'd expect, Service was all around friendly and we totally lucked out too since we were there during the slow season and didn't need to wait for a table and it's unheard of for this place, It's a \"can't miss\" spot, If the line is out the door, I'd suggest you try again to go on an off time, You won't be sorry!\n",

Two stars off for the TERRIBLY shucked oysters, It's an OYSTER HOUSE so you'd think they'd get that right, Oysters were large and meaty, but EVERY one of the two dozen raw oysters we ordered had shell shards, The grilled oysters had shell shards also, Really ruined the experience, I saw people next to us spit out shell chunks, too, I LOVE oysters and had more than 6 dozen during my few nights in NOLA... and this was the only place that had shell shards, Terrible, Grilled oysters were overcooked as well, (I actually recommend Felix's across the street for fresh, meaty raw and grilled oysters, )Two stars because the boo fries are good (but suuuuuper salty).

No, Was it the best? I wouldn't say that either, We ordered a shrimp po boy and oyster platter, The number one mistake I would say is that the food didn't come out hot... it was warmishly cold, The seafood tasted like it may have been frozen, The bread on my po boy was soft and didn't have much of a crunch (a little toasting could have helped).

I was looking forward to this dish but it ruined my appetite, However, the third star is because of great service, Ron recommended clubs for us to see and treated us with great hospitality.\n",

Sarah was still quick to tell us the kitchen was backed up but still ensured our water glasses never were below half way . This was a great experience due to Sarah's knowledge of the menu . She ultimately helped me decide on the catfish platter sub the fries for the red beans and rice (side portion, small but super filling ) It's a relatively relaxed environment jazz music playing in the background , dimmer colored lights, still loud but it not too much . Definitely can sit here and enjoy your watermelon margarita as I did . Do be aware of we came in as a walk-in they take reservations for the evening/dinner crowd .\n",

He filled us in on Maw Maw's Cajun Breakfast, not on the menu, It's Jambalaya with scrambled eggs mixed in with a side of biscuits, Big enough to feed two people! He had the kitchen staff split our plate for us, free of charge! It had a generous amount of shrimps, We both enjoyed our meals with the Louisiana hot sauces that was available for us, Excellent service, yummy food, happy tummies and not too shabby on the pocketbook, Yep, we'll surely come back the next time we're in town.\n",

Seriously, that's one thing I adore about NOLA and which really sets it apart for me, Once my husband arrived to join us, we asked if there was seating out on the patio, We were guided to a table in a central courtyard where we were surrounded by historic walls and windows going up a few stories, So the environment was already on a roll...Enter the FOOD, Now, I don't normally gravitate toward duck, but I was in New Orleans and wanted to try something outside of my norm, When my eyes lighted on the words \"Praline Duck, \" I was hooked, I am here to tell you today that it was one of my top 10 meals ever consumed, I ate every, single, bite, It was a perfect blend of succulent and sweet, I even got that look on my face when my husband (a notorious duck-lover) swiped a bite, I'm going back to NOLA this spring and will absolutely be stopping in for more Praline Duck!\n",

Oceana Grill Saved New Orleans!This summer, my daughter and I spent 2 weeks sampling local foods in Biloxi and New Orleans and I got so tired and bored with the STANDARD FARE of fried/broiled/grilled alligator, shrimp, crab cakes, sausage, trout, catfish, raw oysters and Boudin Balls that a single meal at Oceana Grill made the trip worth it! Hallelujah!Wherever we ate the quintessential jambalaya and etouffee tasted the same and there was a marked absence of vegetables of any kind - no greens at all! WHAT? It seems that all restaurants shared the SAME recipes and the SAME chef!  I am not a fried-foodie so I thought at some point I would see a vegetable but nooooooooo, none , not one ............... until Oceana,  Hallelujah, praise & thanks!At Oceana, the food looked the way food should - no fried crust - just food that LOOK good and tasted even better! I ordered the ''Taste of New Orleans'' which sampled Creole jambalaya, craw fish etouffee, red beans & rice with smoked sausage and sauteed vegetables - it did not disappoint at all,  Free at last - I ate my belly full!My daughter ordered soft shell crab, Oceana's Famous Oysters and Oyster Rockefeller and we almost bit into our fingers! Yep, it was THAT goooooodddddd! Hmmmm, Hmmmm!, Hmmmm!  I have NEVER had anything that good - talk about the smokiness of the sauce, the mild cheesy flavor - it hit every taste bud on my tongue!
