Place is pretty small but the staff was prompt and attentive! Put in our order for chargrilled oysters and some gravy fries and felt like minutes later they were back with our apps. Both where awesome! The chargrilled oysters were definitely the bomb. I think they sprinkle crack on them. \n\nWe had picky teenagers with us and even they ate the oysters and we had to fight them for the last couple. It was loads of fun. We ordered po-boy, beans and rice, bread bowl and gumbo. Everything was okay but doesn't measure up to the oysters. We'd go back for the apps, oysters and beer, but the rest of the food was just ok. \n\nWe were in from out of town and tried several oyster spots before going here.

        "text": "Wow, just wow!   My memory must've been foggy because when I came over 12+ years ago, I didn't remember it being such a slam dunk!\n\nAs you all know, this is one of those touristy places that you have to go to if you've never been to NOLA but for the record, let me tell you, it's SO worth the trip.  We tried Felix, Killer Poboy and NOLA Poboys all in the same week and none of these places served a better Poboy than the Peacemaker at Acme.  So ginormous, you can actually just share this and you'd still be full to the gills.  GET IT!  5/5\n\nAnd contrary to popular opinion as New Englanders, I'd also stuff your face with at least a half dozen of the Chargrilled Oysters as opposed to ordering the standard raw preparation.  Taste tested and confirmed as we ordered both.  I know you're shocked!  Why you ask?  It's actually quite simple.  The local oysters here from the Gulf of Mexico (on average) are much larger yet more milder tasting so it's perfect to try these prepared in other cooking methods.   We absolutely enjoyed these and it's forever changed our perspective that a cooked oyster could never taste as good as the raw variety.  5/5   \n\nIf you're into crab cakes, they do it quite well here too.  Ask for a side of their special house remoulade sauce and make sure you smother it well with it.  You can work it all off later :)  4/5\n\nReally liked the decor of the place too.  It added to the friendly, casual Southern character you'd expect.  Service was all around friendly and we totally lucked out too since we were there during the slow season and didn't need to wait for a table and it's unheard of for this place.  \n\nIt's a \"can't miss\" spot.  If the line is out the door, I'd suggest you try again to go on an off time.  You won't be sorry!",

Prices aren't too bad (but I'm from Los Angeles so I'm used to hyped up prices)... but overpriced for what the place provides.\n\nFirst star off for the terrible service from the woman behind the bar. She looked miserable, like she hated her life. She didn't ask if we wanted a drink, she walked away mid-sentence when we asked a question about the menu, didn't ask if we needed anything else during our meal, no refills on our water, shrugged her shoulders when we commented about the terribly shucked oysters, took forever taking care of our check (you'd think she would wants us out of there with the long line outside!). \n\nTwo stars off for the TERRIBLY shucked oysters. It's an OYSTER HOUSE so you'd think they'd get that right. Oysters were large and meaty, but EVERY one of the two dozen raw oysters we ordered had shell shards. The grilled oysters had shell shards also. Really ruined the experience. I saw people next to us spit out shell chunks, too. I LOVE oysters and had more than 6 dozen during my few nights in NOLA... and this was the only place that had shell shards. Terrible. Grilled oysters were overcooked as well. (I actually recommend Felix's across the street for fresh, meaty raw and grilled oysters.)\n\nTwo stars because the boo fries are good (but suuuuuper salty). Gumbo and jambalaya were good, but COOP'S does it WAY better. \n\nNOT worth the wait. So many other places nearby that do these better! Super disappointed :(",

They have an indoor and outdoor area, we sat indoor.  We ordered the charbroiled oysters, their famous crab cakes, the pasta jambalaya and bread pudding for dessert.  I also got the Abita Andy Gator which apparently has something like 8% alcohol but you can't tell.  Here is the breakdown.\n\n- Charbroiled Oysters - Even though they are not as big as the ones at ACME, I actually liked these better.  These ones were sitting in a butter sauce and not just baked like the ACME ones.  They give you a spork (yes a spork,  like the ones that you get at KFC) to eat them with which actually goes well when eating oysters.  The only drawback was that the bread it came with seamed stale\n- Crab Cakes - You get 2 decent size crab cakes...tasty but I wouldn't say mind blowing\n- Pasta Jambalaya - Pretty good..came with shrimp and alligator sausage.  It was a good change of pace from all that fried stuff and gumbo I had been eating.\n- Beer - I really like the Abita Andy Gator.  It's got good flavor and is perfect for a hot day\n\nTip\n- We got a 10% off coupon from one of those places selling tours and used it with no hassle.",

I made reservations the night before because the first night we thought about getting dinner there, the line was really long (not just there but literally every place we were thinking about dining in) so reservations is the way to go! My only complaint is where we were sat felt like it didn't have any air what so ever so it made the time there a little uncomfortable especially since we had walked almost a mile to get there & it was 90 degrees. So some air would've made the experience a lot better. The food was amazing. I'm sure COVID has a lot to do with the service and being short staffed & the current staff being stretched thin. Our waiter was super nice, the only thing was I think our adult beverages weren't put in and we didn't receive them til we were already eating our entrees. Even then that was not a major issue because if anything, they have to go cups. (Also the Bahama mama... wonderful!)",

We were a little nervous considering this restaurant was featured on Kitchen Nightmares, but decided enough time had passed and improvements were probably made. Was it horrible? No. Was it the best? I wouldn't say that either. We ordered a shrimp po boy and oyster platter. The number one mistake I would say is that the food didn't come out hot... it was warmishly cold. The seafood tasted like it may have been frozen. The bread on my po boy was soft and didn't have much of a crunch (a little toasting could have helped). Service was prompt though, and the waiter was nice. Overall, not a place I'd go out of my way to return to, but if nothing else was open then sure I'd return. (Tip: Acme Oyster House is my favorite seafood restaurant... not just in NOLA, but possibly even in the world)",

        "text": "My group of girlfriends and I went here with the desire of eating pasta. We ordered the crab cake pasta and crawfish fettuccini. We also ordered the blackened redfish that came with a side of jambalaya and greens. \n\nThe crab cake pasta was mediocre - creamy and buttery, the crab cake was typical, but nothing amazing or extra ordinary. This was our favorite of the three dishes. \n\nThe blackened redfish was pretty good. A little over cooked and almost dry in my opinion, but nothing a squeeze of lemon couldn't help. Jambalaya wasn't bad, but greens were not delicious. \n\nThe crawfish fettuccini was sadly terrible. I couldn't stand it anymore after one bite - the pasta was overwhelmingly fishy due to the fishy, horrible quality crawfish.. I was looking forward to this dish but it ruined my appetite. \n\nHowever, the third star is because of great service. Ron recommended clubs for us to see and treated us with great hospitality.",

Only downside was the long wait time for our food . Granted that's expected because this is an extremely popular place to dine at from what I've been told . Sarah was still quick to tell us the kitchen was backed up but still ensured our water glasses never were  below half way . This was a great experience due to Sarah's knowledge of the menu . She ultimately helped me decide on the catfish platter sub the fries for the red beans and rice (side portion, small but super filling ) It's a relatively relaxed environment jazz music playing in the background , dimmer colored lights, still loud but it not too much . Definitely can sit here and enjoy your watermelon margarita as I did . Do be aware of we came in as a walk-in they take reservations for the evening/dinner crowd .",

We were guided to a table in a central courtyard where we were surrounded by historic walls and windows going up a few stories. So the environment was already on a roll...\n\nEnter the FOOD.

Oceana Grill Saved New Orleans!\n\nThis summer, my daughter and I spent 2 weeks sampling local foods in Biloxi and New Orleans and I got so tired and bored with the STANDARD FARE of fried/broiled/grilled alligator, shrimp, crab cakes, sausage, trout, catfish, raw oysters and Boudin Balls that a single meal at Oceana Grill made the trip worth it!  Hallelujah!\n\nWherever we ate the quintessential jambalaya and etouffee tasted the same and there was a marked absence of vegetables of any kind - no greens at all!  WHAT?  It seems that all restaurants shared the SAME recipes and the SAME chef!   I am not a fried-foodie so I thought at some point I would see a vegetable but nooooooooo, none , not one ............... until Oceana.   Hallelujah. praise & thanks!\n\nAt Oceana, the food looked the way food should - no fried crust - just food that LOOK good and tasted even better!  I ordered the ''Taste of New Orleans'' which sampled Creole jambalaya, craw fish etouffee, red beans & rice with smoked sausage and sauteed vegetables -  it did not disappoint at all.   Free at last - I ate my belly full!\n\nMy daughter ordered soft shell crab, Oceana's Famous Oysters and Oyster Rockefeller and we almost bit into our fingers!  Yep, it was THAT goooooodddddd!  Hmmmm, Hmmmm!, Hmmmm!   \n\nI have NEVER had anything that good - talk about the smokiness of the sauce, the mild cheesy flavor - it hit every taste bud on my tongue!  Good Lawd Have is Mercy! \n\nThe food was fantastic at lunch and the 'doggie' was equally great the next day.\n\nI recommend a stop at Oceana Grill the next time you visit New Orleans.
