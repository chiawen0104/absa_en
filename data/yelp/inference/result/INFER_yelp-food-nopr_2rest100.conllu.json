I can have a few more dozens of these and second best item to get and I would highly recommend is their fried fish and it was battered up lightly and the fish was so tender and moist and I had this last year when I visited new orleans and the taste and texture and freshness of the fish was still the same and each bite had its own crunch and I am in love and superb and jambalaya and gumbo was also amazing and my cravings were extremely satisfied! !",

I wouldn't say that either and we ordered a shrimp po boy and oyster platter and the number one mistake I would say is that the food didn't come out hot... it was warmishly cold and the seafood tasted like it may have been frozen and the bread on my po boy was soft and didn't have much of a crunch (a little toasting could have helped) . service was prompt though and and the waiter was nice and overall and not a place I'd go out of my way to return to but if nothing else was open then sure I'd return and (tip : acme oyster house is my favorite seafood restaurant... not just in nola but possibly even in the world )",
