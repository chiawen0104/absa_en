My first experience was better.  Seated at the oyster bar, the shucker was quite friendly.  After serving me 10 oysters (I ordered the half dozen) he asked how I enjoyed them.  \"I dont touch 'em,\" he replied to my favorable review.  It was pretty funny.I also had the seafood gumbo and their signature po'boy, which were both decent.Go for oysters and beer.",

It was chargrilled with garlic, cheese and from what it looks like olive oil? I can have a few more dozens of these! Second best item to get and I would HIGHLY recommend is their fried fish. It was battered up lightly and the fish was so tender and moist. I had this last year when I visited New Orleans and the taste, texture and freshness of the fish was still the same.

We went on a Friday night around 5:45 and there was a few groups in front of ours, but about 20 minutes and we were in the door (the line behind us was stacking up fast and people kept coming!). Place is pretty small but the staff was prompt and attentive! Put in our order for chargrilled oysters and some gravy fries and felt like minutes later they were back with our apps. Both where awesome! The chargrilled oysters were definitely the bomb. I think they sprinkle crack on them. We had picky teenagers with us and even they ate the oysters and we had to fight them for the last couple. It was loads of fun. We ordered po-boy, beans and rice, bread bowl and gumbo. Everything was okay but doesn't measure up to the oysters. We'd go back for the apps, oysters and beer, but the rest of the food was just ok. We were in from out of town and tried several oyster spots before going here. Well worth the wait but you must get the chargrilled oysters. You have better options for entrees but overall we were glad to find this spot.",

        "text": "Wow, just wow!   My memory must've been foggy because when I came over 12+ years ago, I didn't remember it being such a slam dunk!As you all know, this is one of those touristy places that you have to go to if you've never been to NOLA but for the record, let me tell you, it's SO worth the trip.  We tried Felix, Killer Poboy and NOLA Poboys all in the same week and none of these places served a better Poboy than the Peacemaker at Acme.  So ginormous, you can actually just share this and you'd still be full to the gills.  GET IT!  5/5And contrary to popular opinion as New Englanders, I'd also stuff your face with at least a half dozen of the Chargrilled Oysters as opposed to ordering the standard raw preparation.  Taste tested and confirmed as we ordered both.  I know you're shocked!  Why you ask?  It's actually quite simple.  The local oysters here from the Gulf of Mexico (on average) are much larger yet more milder tasting so it's perfect to try these prepared in other cooking methods.   We absolutely enjoyed these and it's forever changed our perspective that a cooked oyster could never taste as good as the raw variety.  5/5   If you're into crab cakes, they do it quite well here too.  Ask for a side of their special house remoulade sauce and make sure you smother it well with it.  You can work it all off later :)  4/5Really liked the decor of the place too.  It added to the friendly, casual Southern character you'd expect.  Service was all around friendly and we totally lucked out too since we were there during the slow season and didn't need to wait for a table and it's unheard of for this place.  It's a \"can't miss\" spot.  If the line is out the door, I'd suggest you try again to go on an off time.  You won't be sorry!",

Prices aren't too bad (but I'm from Los Angeles so I'm used to hyped up prices)... but overpriced for what the place provides.First star off for the terrible service from the woman behind the bar. She looked miserable, like she hated her life. She didn't ask if we wanted a drink, she walked away mid-sentence when we asked a question about the menu, didn't ask if we needed anything else during our meal, no refills on our water, shrugged her shoulders when we commented about the terribly shucked oysters, took forever taking care of our check (you'd think she would wants us out of there with the long line outside!). Two stars off for the TERRIBLY shucked oysters. It's an OYSTER HOUSE so you'd think they'd get that right. Oysters were large and meaty, but EVERY one of the two dozen raw oysters we ordered had shell shards. The grilled oysters had shell shards also. Really ruined the experience. I saw people next to us spit out shell chunks, too. I LOVE oysters and had more than 6 dozen during my few nights in NOLA... and this was the only place that had shell shards. Terrible. Grilled oysters were overcooked as well. (I actually recommend Felix's across the street for fresh, meaty raw and grilled oysters.)Two stars because the boo fries are good (but suuuuuper salty). Gumbo and jambalaya were good, but COOP'S does it WAY better. NOT worth the wait. So many other places nearby that do these better! Super disappointed :(",

        "text": "Ouuuu Bayyy Bayyyyyy!!! I finally made it over to Acme Oyster House, and mannnn... this seafood is everything I've ever wanted in a meal. I started off with an Oyster shooter... scary! One of the kind gentleman chucking oysters at the bar gave me some cocktail sauce mixed with horseradish to chase my shooter with. It woke me up to say the least. I went with the charbroiled oysters on the half shell for my appetizer, and I was very close to licking the buttery goodness off the inner shells of the oysters. For my entree, I went with the seafood étouffée with the crawfish tails. The breaded crawfish tails made me dance just a little. The sauce was very flavorful and plentiful. The staff were very helpful, patient, and kind. It's not often you find a place where the entire staff is smiling, hustling, and just overall happy to be there. Overall, my experience was AMAZIIIIIIIIINGGGGGGG, and I will be back.",

They have an indoor and outdoor area, we sat indoor.  We ordered the charbroiled oysters, their famous crab cakes, the pasta jambalaya and bread pudding for dessert.  I also got the Abita Andy Gator which apparently has something like 8% alcohol but you can't tell.  Here is the breakdown.- Charbroiled Oysters - Even though they are not as big as the ones at ACME, I actually liked these better.  These ones were sitting in a butter sauce and not just baked like the ACME ones.  They give you a spork (yes a spork,  like the ones that you get at KFC) to eat them with which actually goes well when eating oysters.  The only drawback was that the bread it came with seamed stale- Crab Cakes - You get 2 decent size crab cakes...tasty but I wouldn't say mind blowing- Pasta Jambalaya - Pretty good..came with shrimp and alligator sausage.  It was a good change of pace from all that fried stuff and gumbo I had been eating.- Beer - I really like the Abita Andy Gator.  It's got good flavor and is perfect for a hot dayTip- We got a 10% off coupon from one of those places selling tours and used it with no hassle.",

I made reservations the night before because the first night we thought about getting dinner there, the line was really long (not just there but literally every place we were thinking about dining in) so reservations is the way to go! My only complaint is where we were sat felt like it didn't have any air what so ever so it made the time there a little uncomfortable especially since we had walked almost a mile to get there & it was 90 degrees. So some air would've made the experience a lot better. The food was amazing. I'm sure COVID has a lot to do with the service and being short staffed & the current staff being stretched thin. Our waiter was super nice, the only thing was I think our adult beverages weren't put in and we didn't receive them til we were already eating our entrees. Even then that was not a major issue because if anything, they have to go cups. (Also the Bahama mama... wonderful!)",

We were a little nervous considering this restaurant was featured on Kitchen Nightmares, but decided enough time had passed and improvements were probably made. Was it horrible? No. Was it the best? I wouldn't say that either. We ordered a shrimp po boy and oyster platter. The number one mistake I would say is that the food didn't come out hot... it was warmishly cold. The seafood tasted like it may have been frozen. The bread on my po boy was soft and didn't have much of a crunch (a little toasting could have helped). Service was prompt though, and the waiter was nice. Overall, not a place I'd go out of my way to return to, but if nothing else was open then sure I'd return. (Tip: Acme Oyster House is my favorite seafood restaurant... not just in NOLA, but possibly even in the world)",

We also ordered the blackened redfish that came with a side of jambalaya and greens. The crab cake pasta was mediocre - creamy and buttery, the crab cake was typical, but nothing amazing or extra ordinary. This was our favorite of the three dishes. The blackened redfish was pretty good. A little over cooked and almost dry in my opinion, but nothing a squeeze of lemon couldn't help. Jambalaya wasn't bad, but greens were not delicious. The crawfish fettuccini was sadly terrible. I couldn't stand it anymore after one bite - the pasta was overwhelmingly fishy due to the fishy, horrible quality crawfish.. I was looking forward to this dish but it ruined my appetite. However, the third star is because of great service. Ron recommended clubs for us to see and treated us with great hospitality.",

Sarah was still quick to tell us the kitchen was backed up but still ensured our water glasses never were  below half way . This was a great experience due to Sarah's knowledge of the menu . She ultimately helped me decide on the catfish platter sub the fries for the red beans and rice (side portion, small but super filling ) It's a relatively relaxed environment jazz music playing in the background , dimmer colored lights, still loud but it not too much .

We were offered both the breakfast & lunch menu. I Luv me some Breakfast but I wanted to try the Jambalaya on the lunch menu. Our server was great! He filled us in on Maw Maw's Cajun Breakfast, not on the menu. It's Jambalaya with scrambled eggs mixed in with a side of biscuits. Big enough to feed two people! He had the kitchen staff split our plate for us, free of charge! It had a generous amount of shrimps. We both enjoyed our meals with the Louisiana hot sauces that was available for us. Excellent service, yummy food, happy tummies and not too shabby on the pocketbook. Yep, we'll surely come back the next time we're in town.",

Banana foster cheesecake was so good, I wanted to take another piece to carry home. Gumbo- On point. Crawfish Etouffee- on point. Red Beans and Rice- on point. I got all of these things in the taste of New Orleans platter (subbed gumbo for jambalaya). $16 and I ate like a queen. I cant wait to return.",

        "text": "Wow, so disappointed. We started with appetizers which were only warm and that was the best thing about them. The BBQ shrimp was over cooked and you got 5 shrimp for 12 bucks. The crab cakes were better but were more breading than crab. Our drinks were super weak and after 5 drinks and 6 appetizers we spent over a hundred bucks. Left there and went back to the Hyatt. Way more expensive but but great drinks and food.",

We shared the crabmeat cakes for an appetizer and they were AMAZING. Also split dinner, the Taste of New Orleans. We loved it all! Felt like a great first stop in a city we think we'll love.One star off because service was a bit slow. Very nice and polite, just a little slow.",

One great thing is that this restaurant is open late with a great atmosphere. Food:Blacken red fish: delicious, if I could order one dish, this would be it.Jambalaya pasta: cannot go wrong, another great recommendation.Cajun Fries: more than I expected, I was expecting something dry, it is heavy in sauce and crawfish, not bad. Blacken duck: taste like a heavily seasoned chicken.Crab cakes: taste like the ocean with extra salt, definitely not freshGreat option when lots of restaurants are closed.",

        "text": "There are very specific moments of my last trip to New Orleans which spring to mind, and one of those is my dining experience at Oceana.Two words: Praline DuckOMG. But let me back up...My friend Anh and I initially entered and were seated near the front door, which turned out great for a spell because we were able to see and hear a brass parade going down the road! Seriously, that's one thing I adore about NOLA and which really sets it apart for me.Once my husband arrived to join us, we asked if there was seating out on the patio. We were guided to a table in a central courtyard where we were surrounded by historic walls and windows going up a few stories. So the environment was already on a roll...Enter the FOOD. Now, I don't normally gravitate toward duck, but I was in New Orleans and wanted to try something outside of my norm. When my eyes lighted on the words \"Praline Duck,\" I was hooked.I am here to tell you today that it was one of my top 10 meals ever consumed. I ate every.single.bite. It was a perfect blend of succulent and sweet. I even got that look on my face when my husband (a notorious duck-lover) swiped a bite.I'm going back to NOLA this spring and will absolutely be stopping in for more Praline Duck!",

Oceana Grill Saved New Orleans!This summer, my daughter and I spent 2 weeks sampling local foods in Biloxi and New Orleans and I got so tired and bored with the STANDARD FARE of fried/broiled/grilled alligator, shrimp, crab cakes, sausage, trout, catfish, raw oysters and Boudin Balls that a single meal at Oceana Grill made the trip worth it!  Hallelujah!Wherever we ate the quintessential jambalaya and etouffee tasted the same and there was a marked absence of vegetables of any kind - no greens at all!  WHAT?  It seems that all restaurants shared the SAME recipes and the SAME chef!   I am not a fried-foodie so I thought at some point I would see a vegetable but nooooooooo, none , not one ............... until Oceana.   Hallelujah. praise & thanks!At Oceana, the food looked the way food should - no fried crust - just food that LOOK good and tasted even better!  I ordered the ''Taste of New Orleans'' which sampled Creole jambalaya, craw fish etouffee, red beans & rice with smoked sausage and sauteed vegetables -  it did not disappoint at all.   Free at last - I ate my belly full!My daughter ordered soft shell crab, Oceana's Famous Oysters and Oyster Rockefeller and we almost bit into our fingers!  Yep, it was THAT goooooodddddd!  Hmmmm, Hmmmm!, Hmmmm!   I have NEVER had anything that good - talk about the smokiness of the sauce, the mild cheesy flavor - it hit every taste bud on my tongue!  Good Lawd Have is Mercy! The food was fantastic at lunch and the 'doggie' was equally great the next day.I recommend a stop at Oceana Grill the next time you visit New Orleans.  You will not regret it!",

The rice for the gumbo was hard, as if it was from previous day or refrigerated/defrosted. The service was not great either, aside from the nice hostess at the front. I wouldn't recommend this place for seafood, but maybe the po boys are good.",
