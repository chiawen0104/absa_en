I can have a few more dozens of these and second best item to get and I would highly recommend is their fried fish and it was battered up lightly and the fish was so tender and moist and I had this last year when I visited new orleans and the taste and texture and freshness of the fish was still the same and each bite had its own crunch and I am in love and superb and jambalaya and gumbo was also amazing and my cravings were extremely satisfied! !",

I wouldn't say that either and we ordered a shrimp po boy and oyster platter and the number one mistake I would say is that the food didn't come out hot... it was warmishly cold and the seafood tasted like it may have been frozen and the bread on my po boy was soft and didn't have much of a crunch (a little toasting could have helped) . service was prompt though and and the waiter was nice and overall and not a place I'd go out of my way to return to but if nothing else was open then sure I'd return and (tip : acme oyster house is my favorite seafood restaurant... not just in nola but possibly even in the world )",

        "text": "there are very specific moments of my last trip to new orleans which spring to mind and and one of those is my dining experience at oceana ,two words : praline duckomg but let me back up...my friend anh and I initially entered and were seated near the front door and which turned out great for a spell because we were able to see and hear a brass parade going down the road and seriously and that's one thing I adore about nola and which really sets it apart for me ,once my husband arrived to join us and we asked if there was seating out on the patio and we were guided to a table in a central courtyard where we were surrounded by historic walls and windows going up a few stories and so the environment was already on a roll...enter the food and now and I don't normally gravitate toward duck but I was in new orleans and wanted to try something outside of my norm and when my eyes lighted on the words \"praline duck, \" I was hooked ,I am here to tell you today that it was one of my top 10 meals ever consumed and I ate every ,single ,bite and it was a perfect blend of succulent and sweet and I even got that look on my face when my husband (a notorious duck-lover ) swiped a bite ,I'm going back to nola this spring and will absolutely be stopping in for more praline duck !",
