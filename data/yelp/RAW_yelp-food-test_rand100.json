I was told that they would be open and that the hours were 8 to 8.  When we arrived about 7:05 we found the doors locked.  My husband went around to the back door and entered.  He was told that they were now closed because they didn't have any business.  Needless to say, we were not happy.  The staff in the restaurant said that we should be sure to make a reservation so they would know that someone was coming!  The staff apologized and said it was company policy.  We proceeded to go to Montgomery's and had a great time.",

The dining area is immaculate and well kept. There are even a few tables outside if you wanted to relax and ease into your day with your coffee. They have a wide variety of donuts which are all very tasty. I think I've had just about all of them at this point. The donuts are rich and cakey, not at all light. They are very reasonably priced for the quality of donuts you receive. They are all made fresh to order so they are still warm when you eat them. I am lucky to have them right in my neighborhood but if it were not in the neighborhood, I wouldn't mind taking a drive to pick up a dozen or two.",

Airy/Germantown area now for 9 years and often dine further away and do not venture enough in my own hood !\n\nTwo dear friends and I stumbled upon Grain Exchange when we were trying to find a decent place to eat after 9p last evening and it came up right away on Yelp.   I knew it had received good reviews so was happy to have the opportunity to finally check it out first-hand.\n\nService was enthusiastic and warm and welcoming.\n\nThe atmosphere was both funky and quaint.\n\nA fantastic menu selection,  including an entire page of vegetarian items.\n\nWe started off with fried pickles ...  I have no words.  Just a lot of joyful groaning !\n\nThe pulled pork sandwich was tender and had crunchy surprises like pickles and cabbage that married perfectly.   They offer 3 different sauces:  a spicy (which was great yet not really all that spicy);  a sweet (not a fan);  and a vinegar (my favorite !).   The best part, however, of the meal which blew me and my dining partners away were the sweet potato fries !  Huge thick perfectly roasted specimens of sweet potato fry heaven, with just the right amount of salt.   Put the vinegar on them as suggested by our server and your mouth and belly will thank you.\n\nOne friend got the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich and utterly loved it - esp the mayo that is given with it.   \n\nThe other friend got the fried fish sandwich and was equally delighted.\n\nGreat giving business to the local peeps.   They do it up right !!!",

The cashiers are always very friendly.\n\nRest assured they have a loyalty program similar to chain grocery stores.

It gets only four stars because outside of happy hour it's a bit overpriced and though there are many beers on tap, during the summer it was difficult to find a Stout or Porter on draught, which I understand is likely not in great demand during the summer but I was hopeful since the name implies they specialize in beer to find at least a couple of beers of the style I enjoy most. I will come back for the five dollar cocktails during happy hour again and hope during winter they have some good stouts and porters on draught as draft beers are the most reasonably priced. They do have some unique bottled beers but at $7.50-$15 per bottle it's a little more difficult for me to enjoy. Overall nice place though, I would recommend it for a beer and a snack or anytime during happy hour.",

We were seated right on time, and the service was prompt and friendly even though you could tell they were extremely busy. \n\nDefinitely expect to be seated right on top of each other, I have never seen a table so close to my table in a restaurant before! However, I went here expecting that and surprisingly didn't mind too much. The dining room was loud since it's quite packed, but in a boisterous way that added an upbeat atmosphere. I was also with a bunch of friends though, so I can see how that would be annoying if I was on a date or something. The food was delicious, and the tastes were unique. The prices were absolutely phenomenal for a restaurant in center city. \n\nOverall, I had a good experience here and will definitely be back since the atmosphere was enjoyable, the food was good, and the prices were unbeatable!",

When he is running the window/drive-through, things flow and your order comes out (9 times out of 10) correct.  So this review is in no way a reflection on him! This facility however, needs more workers like Chris. I don't know what is happening here but lately they've had a really tough time getting my order correct. Hardly anyone repeats your order back to you at the speaker.  Today (like previous days) I had to pull forward and wait for my order. When the young man brought my order out it was wrong. After I told him what I ordered, I waited, and my order came out wrong AGAIN! Do people have a hard time hearing? Are the headsets for the drive-through that crappy that the workers cannot hear the orders? Or, are they just not paying attention?  I've been coming to this DD for years because the service has always been spot on (until recently) and the workers were always super nice. I've noticed a change in both. Chris needs some good help! Hope this company will get him some! And Chris, if you are reading this, thank you! YOU ROCK!!!",

Lots of cool places to kick back inside or out.\n\nI should go back and rewrite this, because it sounds like an ad written by the owner or something, but I have to be somewhere in twenty minutes.

Heck, I'd prefer to go to Flemings right down the road in Marlton -- same prices (or better) and 100x better and fancier.\n\nI'm not 100% sure, but I remember feeling a little miffed at the choices of sides and their prices.\n\nThe salad bar is extensive, but who really goes out to a steak house for salad? If you want a great salad bar come here, but if you want steak go to Flemings (or Outback honestly).",

During a moment of deep meditation (okay fine, my mom suggested it lol) I decided to celebrate another trip around the sun at Krab Kingz.\n\nThe location itself is nothing special, tucked in a nondescript strip mall off of Watson.  The interior is sparse and smallish, but the staff gives off a welcoming vibe that makes it all seem enduring.  I ordered a #2 that included two crab clusters, shrimp, sausage, two hard boiled eggs and potatoes.  I also added a lobster tail for good measure.  The thing that sets everything off right is the choice of seasoned butters that are offered.  I went with Cajun and a spicy butter on the side (be warned it is truly spicy, a plus for me). Everything was delicious \n\n I definitely won't wait another year to come as it's now gonna be my go to spot whenever I have a hankering for crab legs.",

Also he read us our contract and since we are a non-profit group he waived the room rental fee. We have never had to pay a room rental fee. At the end almost to punish us he tried to get $150 out of us even though the contract said no room rental fee. Our meals came out cold. We had to send back our ribs. We ordered a full rack of ribs and were served a half rack.. 6 ribs is not a full rack. He messed up our bill several times before he made it right. Our waitress Jesse was very nice.

It was our first time so when we came in we were a little confused on whether were supposed to be seated or not. There seemed to be a host area, but no host. After standing around for a few minutes a waitress eventually told us we could sit where we want. So we found a booth and then waited a while for the waitress to finally come around.\n\nWe all ordered wings, they have a 35 cent special on Mondays that start earlier than Wingstop. I ordered BBQ and some of my friends ordered Buffalo but they ended up mostly tasting the same, with no real kick in the Buffalo wings without going to hot. \n\nThe waitress was okay, not on her A-game, but seemed to be trying to an extent. We wanted to order some wings to go as well, but apparently there is a policy against that, and french fries took forever to come until after our meal was pretty much over. \n\nYou also have to order a drink besides water as a condition of getting 35 cent wings, which is at least $2.49 for a regular drink, so the savings kind of balance out. Overall, good food but not my favorite experience.",

Food was pretty good, we had the fried calamari and crab tostadas. The crab meat was sweet and based on the color and texture I believe it was blue crab. The reason for 3.5 stars is the service was lacking a little bit. It took a while to place our order and to get our drinks, it was a Friday night but it wasn't too busy as there was no wait for a table. Also the pricing is pretty high for what you get. I understand that seafood is high in Tucson but 5.50 for a shrimp taco is a bit much. I will probably be back as I stated before the food is excellent but maybe I'll wait for a day that I feel like splurging quite a bit",

Ugh, pass. \n\n My friends and I picked a table closest to the water near the larger bar. Bad idea if you want table service because you might end up waiting anywhere from a minute to FORTY minutes just to get drink orders in.  Despite our large group and trying to hail whomever was around to grab our order,  we ended up only getting our orders in about an hour after we sat down. That was indeed a bummer.   Anywhoo,ordered the  italian sausage because I was starving and my friend had told me that their burgers weren't really on point. I expected the sausage to be just like any other sausage:bit greasy but flavorful. I knew it would be coming with some kale and garnish on top, but when I bit into the entire thing, the kale tasted literally like grass. I dumped the kale-garnish to the side and ate only about a half of the sausage. The sausage itself tasted as if it were burnt ( i couldn't really tell because of course it was dark as hell ). My other friend ordered the pickled beans or asparagus (something green that was pickled). That was pretty solid and was consumed within minutes. Their clam sandwich was made as if, in the words of my friend, \"someone just dumped a bunch of clam meat into an open hamburger bun and hoped the sauce would flavor it up. \"  She wasn't too thrilled by the lack of oomph for the sandwich and didn't eat the entire thing.  The fries were nothing special-not even any rosemary or spices to coat the fries.\n\nOur waiter was helpful and even returned for us a few drink orders that weren't made up to par with no hesitation.",

        "text": "Livery has been at the top of my 'must-visit' list for YEARS, and last night, I finally made it in. I'm happy to report that it was worth the hype and even better than we imagined. We booked a weeknight reservation for two, found easy parking on Mass Ave, and were immediately seated at a comfy table. The dim lighting, luxe chairs and kind servers made for a great atmosphere. Bonus: I thought the guy dining next to us worked at the restaurant because of how many servers he knew, but my husband told me afterwards that he was a Colts player (LOL). \n\nAfter reading through the hundreds of rave Yelp reviews and doing our research, we decided to order the following (with a Metazoa Peanut Butter Porter beer - SO good):\n\nYuca fries: Huge, nicely-fried and topped in a nice sauce and chihuahua cheese.\n\nLamb empanadas: Our favorite item of the night. They seriously melt in your mouth and the meat was incredibly high quality. They came with a poblano crema dipping sauce that was DELICIOUS. I couldn't believe that it was only $9 for three empanadas. So great and not spicy at all.\n\nSkirt steak: My second favorite item of the night. The steak was cooked perfectly and tasted great with the broccolini, tomato crema, jalapeno butter and manchego-polenta fries. \n\nCanelones: Almost like latin-inspired crepe full of pulled chicken, tomato sauce, tomato crema and salsa. It was super good but slightly spicy. \n\nI've heard that the churros and flan here are incredible too, so we'll definitely be back for those soon! I also can't wait to come back when it's warm and sit on the rooftop. Be sure to get a reservation before stopping in here, as this place is POPULAR!",

        "text": "We arrived at Mekenita Cantina on a Saturday afternoon for a late lunch. The inside is very trendy, with lots of big wooden booths and a small bar inside which is beautifully tiled. We were seated immediately and given complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were so good, they had just the right amount of seasoning. The salsa was good as well, a little on the smoky side. I do wish they offered queso here, I think it would be delicious.\n\nThe house margaritas here are fantastic! It's weird to me that they don't have them listed on their drink menu, but ask your waiter about them. They were so tasty and very strong. We ordered a pitcher and it definitely wasn't watered down like most normally are. They also use pellet ice or \"Sonic ice\" as I call it which makes them that much better.\n\nFor entrees we ordered the Crab & Roasted Poblano Enchiladas and the Chili Garlic Smoked Pork Enchiladas. Both were absolutely delicious, the Crab & Roasted Poblano Enchiladas were super creamy while the Pork Enchiladas are covered in their traditional Mole Negro so it was much more of a smoky flavor. You aren't going to find your traditional Tex-Mex here, it's definitely more authentic Mexican (which I didn't mind) but you'll definitely find more strong and smoky flavors. The side salad that came with it was surprisingly really good and the dressing had a nice kick.\n\nService was good though they were running extremely far behind. The manager was actually walking around to all of the tables apologizing and explaining why their food was taking so long which I really appreciated. He even comped a few diner's meals since it took so long. It's rare to see a manager making things right like that. As a side note, the parking lot is SO small. They tried to cram way too many parking spots and it's a super narrow mess, but don't let that deter you. Price were a little higher than your normal Tex-Mex joint, but well worth the price in my opinion.",

        "text": "First off, reservations are a definite smart idea.  My friend and I met there at the bar at 5:30 and had a table reservation for 6.  I don't think they start seating people until 6 anyways.  By 6:30/6:45 the place was packed including the bar and stayed that way even as we were leaving at 8:30.  My friend described the vibe and decor as \"Restoration Hardware-ish\" and she really like it.  It is a trendy upscale place for sure.\n\nThey don't have an expansive craft beer list, but they do have a respectable craft beer list.  From Terrapin Hopsecutioner and Moo-Hoo to Good People Pale Ale.\n\nThere is valet parking, but if you are lucky like I was you can find a spot on the street.\n\nI will say that my experience at the table was more enjoyable than at the bar.  While there wasn't anything wrong with the bartender and he was friendly enough, there was also an aloof attitude there.  Although, I will say that I've been feeling like that a lot around town with the bartenders.  I think it is actually the vibe they are going for.  But again, he was friendly enough.\n\nOur waitress was very friendly and could read when we were talking in depth to not interrupt us.\n\nWe started off with the Lobster Bread.  It was a $14 \"Bite\" and was 4 small toasts that had a bit of lobster on top.  This was probably the least enjoyable part of the meal.  Not that it was bad.  It was just an okay appetizer.  While I understand that the lobster is the reason behind the $14 price tag, I wouldn't order this again because I didn't feel it was worth the price.  If they could find a way to bring the price down to $10 then it's more of an appetizer price.\n\nMy friend ordered the Brussel Sprouts from the \"Vegetable\" portion.  These. Were. Insane!  I would order these just for my entree if I go again.  And they are big reason behind the 3 stars.  Luckily my friend let me split these with her!\n\nFor the entree, I ordered the Scallops and my friend ordered the Spaetzel.  The Scallops were $21.  For that price, you received 3 sizeable perfectly prepared scallops.  They were atop a small bed of roasted potatoes and mushrooms and small cubes of ham.  While I appreciated that the serving was a perfect size for one, $21 for 3 scallops is still a bit pricey.  Let me be clear that I don't mind pricey and I don't care to be served a ginormous plateful of food that I cannot eat.  But I think that if this dish were at $15-17, I'd be ordering this all day long.\n\nMy friend enjoyed her spaetzel and pork belly and had enough to take leftovers home.  I'm not a fan of whole grain mustard and this dish is full of it.  So I did not have a taste of this.\n\nAll in all, it was an enjoyable meal, but a lot of it was that I was able to catch up with a friend I had not seen in while.\n\nI think they are doing a lot of things right here and there is a lot of potential.  I would go back if the prices dropped a bit.  But it is a great spot in 12 South and they are lucky to have it!",

        "text": "(4.5 stars) This place feels like a chill spot to sit at the bar and grab some whiskey, and it has some pretty great food. Though, the place doesn't feel like it was really meant to serve food. Seating is super scarce, and handling just our party of 3 seemed challenging, so we ended up having to sit at the bar. \n\nI was going to go with a burger, as I normally do when choosing between breakfast and lunch, but the burgers don't come with fries, which makes them even pricier than they already are. So, I went with the village breakfast to try a bunch of things. I'd highly recommend it, especially at only $13. \n\nI really appreciated their take on toast, which wasn't simply slices of white or wheat like you would get most elsewhere, but instead was sliced baguette drizzled with olive oil. The Andouille sausage had a real nice kick to it, the eggs were light and fresh, the potatoes had a bit of a crisp to them, and the slaw of onions and peppers atop the potatoes was an effective, tasty bridge to the rest of the plate. It won't disappoint.",

Although Green Table didn't have anything I could eat on the menu, Emma sat with me and discussed all my options until they found something yummy and delicious for me! I am so grateful.

        "text": "Just returned from a great meal at Palladino's.  Everything my party ordered was delicious.  I had the rib eye rare, kale salad and the potato galette, as well as shared bites of the oyster app and a mushroom item.  Everything was perfectly cooked and delivered to our table with perfect timing.  We devoured it all and I have nothing but praise for the food.  Our service was also very good. \n\nIt was not terribly busy for a Friday night, which surprised me, so we got a table immediately without reservations.  That usually makes me nervous but It was a great meal.  Chalk it up to the weather, which was our good luck.  \n\nAnd this is for the owner:  I would not have questioned the high prices if the decor was just more refined.  If you're going to charge Rittenhouse Square  prices ( $38 for a steak with sides another $7 per) get rid of the televisions showing loops of scenes from Italy that makes me hear Mario Perrillo's voice in my head.  Spending this kind of money on a meal (about $300 for a party of three with drinks, apps, entrees, sides, desserts) is a huge treat for most people including me, so I don't want to look at an electronic screen after staring at one all week.  The food I ate on this visit deserved to be the focus.  It did not make my food taste less delicious, but I think you will make more money if you keep it cleaner, design wise.  \n\nThe food is different than the other spots on the Avenue so I think fills a unique niche. I look forward to trying other items on the menu, and will just try to sit out of the line of sight of the televisions.",

        "text": "Another solid option for dinner has come to downtown Franklin. Fortunately for me, we haven't had a chance to check it out until now. It appears that they have worked out some of the issues that others have complained about in previous reviews.\n\nLocated in the former Gray's Pharmacy building, the restaurant consists of three stories of dining space. My husband and I decide to check out the recently established restaurant.\n\nAs typical of downtown Franklin, the restaurant has a nice ambiance with the architecture and exposed brick. When we arrived at 5:45 p.m. we were told that they were completely booked for the night with reservations (which I find odd that that they book EVERY table in advanced like that). However they do have open seating in the bar area on the second floor. Luckily, we were there early and found a seat at a two seater table in the area (the bar area has enough space to seat about 7 couples at tables plus about 10 seats at the bar and 4 bar top tables to stand at). We usually make reservations, but at the time, I didn't even know what the name of the restaurant was!\n\nThe menu is a combination of small plates (a nice variety of options) and about 6-8 entrees. We decided to share three small plates. We had the chorizo corn dogs, hot chicken, and the fried pimento cheese balls with homemade whisky pepper jelly. My husband enjoyed them all. I wasn't a huge fan of the corn dogs, but I'm not a huge chorizo fan. The hot chicken had good heat, and was served on toasted white bread and pickles. I really liked the creamy sauce served with the hot chicken. The pimento cheese balls with the pepper jelly were my favorite.\n\nWe had banana foster for dessert. The bananas were wrapped in tortillas, deep fried, cut in half, and served over the sauce. It was good, but I much prefer the bananas cooked in the sauce.\n\nApparently this place is the first \"brandy bar\" in the country. I don't drink brandy, so brandy mixed drinks didn't appeal to me. However, they have a great beer selection-not the everyday brews you see everywhere else!\n\nEverything on the menu looked good. The service on our visit was excellent as well. We were definitely impressed enough that we'll check them out again in the future, and maybe catch some of the live music (they have a nice stage on the second floor).",

The restaurant is very clean, the service is superb and even though there's always a line, they move really fast. \n\nI always get the super deluxe and their bread is always fresh and all the meats and veggies are on point. Their portions are \"just right.\" \n\nTino's also has a large variety of Italian goods and other hard to find goodies. \n\nThis place is a \"weekly\" must if you live near by.",

        "text": "My husband and myself decided to try a new place after moving here a few months ago.  We had a feeling after arriving at the restaurant on a friday evening with only a few table filled that the food was terrible to say the least.  I had ordered the wood planked samon with sides of garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli.  The samon tasted like it was sitting in the fridge/freezer for a year, and the garlic mashed potatoes had hard pieces of potato in it, garlic fumes were coming out of my nose, and the broccoli was brown.  My husband had ordered grouper, again it tasted like they had it a year ago sitting around waiting to be eaten the fries were a joke-just a handful, and the corn was the kind in the frozen section of the grocery store that was mushy.  I would never ever recommend this place, and wonder how they are still open......What is up with the paper towels hanging over each table on a wire hanger?Tacky,tacky,tacky.  UGH.............I would rather starve.",

A great deal in my opinion. I'd definitely recommend the yucca fries and Cauliflower and shishito for starters. I had the chicken enchilada verde and my wife got the pork pastor. Both were great but I the chicken enchilada  was the favorite for both of us. We will definitely be back again!",

Some of our favorite dishes are just not as pleasing as they used to be: spring rolls, dumplings, mei fun, and skimpy orders of sesame chicken. \n\nWe had a great run. All the best to the China Dragon.\n\nOct 2015\nSo for suburban DelCo Chinese... this is darn good eats. And - it's family. \nSupporting a business where you see a family at work together is a plus. \n\nThe dishes are made to order with special instructions always noted... spicy, fried hard, light sauce, etc. \n\nPick up or delivery - the time frames are always spot on as well. They have a good thing going on at China Dragon.",
