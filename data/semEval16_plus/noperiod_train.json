I and d go somewhere else to avoid disappointment .",

        "text": "wonderful facility but ... hotel was great with a superb staff and room and restaurants and we chose the hotel for relaxation before our journey home and the sky ( spa ) was a disappointment · not due to facility and the sauna / steam room area was constantly invaded by families and singles in swim wear and including children with goggle and floaties · with no spa etiquette and the staff did an excellent job of keeping unaccompanied children out of pool and work out area and however and the sauna / steam room area was not managed as well and I suggest the staff tell quests proper etiquette and dress for use of those facilities as well as additional signage so guests like us can enjoy the excellent facilities .",
