The ambiance was a peaceful and relaxing break amongst all the kids running around in Downtown Disney. It was romantic - and even nice even with my sister, reminded me of Italy, and had artwork and music that kept up the feeling of being in a Mediterrean villa. I recommend it for a night when you want to splurge! (it was a bit expensive)",

We were seated right away, the table was private and nice. The service was exceptional - sometime there was a feeling that we were served by the army of friendly waiters. The food was very good, filet mignon was probably the best I've ever try. The portions are big though, so do not order too much. The most pleasant surprise was the check that did not exceed my expectations as it always happens in most of the places. The bathroom itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink, the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser.",

The presentation of Snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu. The pancakes were certainly inventive but $8.50 for 3 - 6\" pancakes (one of them was more like 5\") in the pancake flight (sample of 3 different pancakes) is well over-priced. The flavors were good but I have had far better pancakes at a German pancake specialty restaurant that were a little cheaper but significantly larger.",
